--- 1.1.9.1 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- File dialogs would crash on Linux in the 1.1.9
  release. [bjorn]

--- 1.1.9 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Calculations of smoothing groups in the Wavefront exporter
  could crash if there was two different edges between the same pair
  of vertices. (Thanks to Siber for reporting this bug.)
  
  For plugin developers: A new field, sg, containing an integer
  representing the smoothing group has been added to the #e3d_face{}
  record. Plug-ins using that record must be re-compiled. [bjorng]

- In the Smoothed Preview mode, changes to vertex colors or
  UV coordinates would not be visible. (Thanks to FonteBoa.) [bjorng]

- Fixed the bugs in the View|Show Colors and View|Show Materials
  reported by Micheus. Also made sure that a change to the vertex
  color option of a material would immediately be seen in the
  scene. [bjorng]

- Repeat cmds for Extrude now fixed. (Thanks to Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- Bevel for vertices now properly updates UV coordinates and
  vertex colors dynamically during dragging. (In the Smoothed Preview
  mode, the UV coordinates will only become correct when the drag
  has finished.) [bjorng]

- If the workaround against disappearing text was enabled,
  there would be crash when attempting to display any character
  not included in the fonts, which could happen when using the
  file dialog on Linux to browse a file system where the filenames
  are encoded using UTF-8. (Thanks to mifth.) [bjorng]

- In the file dialog on Mac OS X, selecting a filename
  containing non-US ASCII characters (such as the Swedish
  letters Å, Ä, or Ö) would cause a hard crash. [bjorng]

- By default, the file dialog box for Linux now assumes
  that filenames are encoded in UTF-8. There is a new checkbox
  to revert to the previous behaviour (that is, to assume that
  filenames are encoded in ISO latin1). [bjorng]

--- 1.1.8 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Switching to the Smoothed Preview mode would cause a crash
  if there were any area lights in the scene. (Thanks to Micheus.)
  [bjorng]

- For plug-in developers: The new function wpa:version/0
  returns the version string for Wings. [bjorng]

- Edit|Repeat (Ctrl+D) was broken since 1.1.3. Either it did nothing
  at all or caused a crashed. (Thanks to optigon and deerwood.) [bjorng]

- Magnet Mask|Select bugs fixed. (Thanks to GetaVe and Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- Using one of the commands Show Colors, Show Materials, or
  Show Textures in the View|Show sub-menu, the scene would not be
  immediately updated to reflect the change. Furthermore, if
  Show Colors was turned off and there was an object with vertex
  colors in the scene, there would be a crash. [bjorng]

- AutoUV used to hold a copy of the scene to be able to
  generate a texture with vertex colors or materials.
  
  This extra scene copy has been eliminated. When doing the initial
  UV mapping of an object without previous UV coordinates, the
  materials on the object will be converted to vertex colors (this
  will only be done if there are no previous vertex colors in the
  object AND if the object has non-default materials). The vertex
  colors in the object can later be used to generate a texture.
  
  With this change, vertex colors generated by the Ambient Occlusion
  command can now be baked into a texture. [bjorng]

- If the material 'default' in a .wings file does not have exactly
  the same properties as the 'default' material in Wings, the material
  itself would be renamed to something else (typically 'default2'),
  but the material for the faces that used the material would NOT
  be assigned the new name. [bjorng]

- The object mode (vertex color/material) for objects has
  been eliminated.
  
  Instead materials have a Vertex Colors setting that can be
  "Ignore" (don't use vertex colors; default for new materials),
  "Set" (to use vertex colors instead of the colors in the material),
  and "Multiply" (to multiply vertex colors with the diffuse texture).
  
  The material "default" has "Set" as the value for the "Vertex Colors"
  property, meaning that if you assign vertex colors to face having
  the "default" material, the vertex colors will be visible.
  
  There is a new command (with a sub-menu) in the body mode menu called
  "Vertex Attributes".
  
  When opening a .wings file written by Wings 1.1.7 or earlier, the
  object modes for the objects in the file will be ignored. If there
  are vertex colors, they will be visible on faces that have
  the 'default' material assigned. For faces with other materials,
  the colors or textures in the material will be shown (even if
  the object was in vertex color mode).
  
  When saving a .wings file in this version of Wings and opening
  it in an older version of Wings, all objects will be in
  material mode (even if they have vertex colors).
  
  For plug-in writers: #we.mode has been removed. It also means that
  plug-ins that use #we{} needs to be re-compiled. [bjorng]

--- 1.1.7 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In rare circumstances, the progress bar could reach 1.0
  (the far end) even if the operation was not finished and cause
  Wings to crash hard. (Thanks to deerwood.) [bjorng]

- The smooth proxy is now updated directly when invoking
  interactive commands. [dgud]

- New Feature: Create Bounding Box added to the primitives menu. [optigon]

- Scale to Bounding Box selections now keep their original centre. [optigon]

- Turn Edge now preserves Hard Edges. (Thanks to BlackHarmo). [optigon]

- New Feature: Select|Edge Loop|To Complete Loops turns any selection
  into an edge loop selection. Works from all selection modes and is based on
  the request by deerwood to be able to extend loops beyond where they stop
  when using the regular Edge Loop command (L). [optigon]

- Dissolve and Collapse cmds now delete wholly selected efficiently. [optigon]

- Shared vertices are now eliminated on import. (The
  modeling commands in Wings does not allow creating of shared
  vertices (also called waists), i.e. faces that only share vertices
  but no edges, so it should not be allowed on import.) [bjorng]

- When displaying objects that have a virtual mirror face in
  the smooth preview mode (i.e. turning off workmode by pressing TAB),
  the seam between the real part of the object and mirror image will
  now be soft. The Smooth command (and the Smooth Proxy mode) will
  still sub-divide faces around the virtual mirror face as if the
  edges were hard, so Smoothing before freezing the mirror and
  after freezing may still not give exactly the same result
  (how close the result is depends on the object; for some objects
  the difference may not be noticeable). [bjorng]

- New Feature: Magnet Mask Deselect - Subtracts locked elements from
  the current selection. (Thanks to Fonte Boa) [metadave, optigon]
  
  Magnet Mask Select - fixed: Adds locked elements to current selection.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa). [optigon]

--- 1.1.6 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Re-exporting an imported model with tesselation could
  cause a crash. Also, when importing objects that had UV coordinates
  on some faces but not all, UV coordinates would be discarded
  on both side of edges that only had UV coordinates on one side.
  (Thanks to Siber.) [bjorng]

- Separating, then Combining an object with vertex
  attributes would cause a crash. (Thanks to zdarby.) [bjorng]

- Smoothing objects with hidden faces would crash. [bjorng]

- The command Select By|Id would crash in body mode. [bjorng]

- Eliminate selection glitches where elements behind a face
  could be selected through the face. (Thanks to deerwood.) [bjorng]

- Wings would freeze if there were empty objects in the
  scene. (Empty objects can only be created by import or possibly
  by a plug-in, as the core Wings commands will delete an object
  that becomes empty.) [bjorng]

- The Ambient Occlusion plugin will now correctly
  ignore hidden or locked objects. [scorpius]

- Some fixes and improvements to Edge|Circularise. Open edge loops
  should process more uniformly. (Thanks to puzzledpaul). [optigon]

- Warp mouse to proper position follow drag in Tweak. [optigon]

- Toggling xyz constraints in tweak wouldn't update the info line.
  Now fixed. [optigon]

- Tweak Slide would not work correctly for single edges and
  would not work at all for selections of two unconnected vertices.
  Now fixed. (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- Tweak Slide would not stop at edges. Also made some
  optimisations. [optigon]

--- 1.1.5 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed Tweak drag Normal. (Thanks to Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- Moving or duplicating a light in body mode would cause
  a crash on the next attempt to select anything.
  (Thanks to extrudeface.) [bjorng]

- Marquee selection would selected locked vertices or edges.
  (Thanks to ycarry.) [bjorng]

- Select|Similar is now faster if the initial selection
  contains elements that are similar to each other.
  (Thanks to Ran13.) [bjorng]

- The Wavefront (OBJ) exporter now tries to minimize
  the number of smoothing groups. (Thanks to Ran13.) [bjorng]

- Fixed loading models when in smooth-preview mode.
  Reported by Ran13. [dgud]

- There is a major internal change in how vertex attributes
  (i.e. vertex colors and UV coordinates that are associated with
  a vertex in a particular face) are handled.
  
  Vertex attributes used to be stored in the edge table (with
  two words per edge always reserved for vertex attributes)
  and each vertex could have EITHER a vertex color or
  UV coordinates.
  
  Vertex attributes are now stored by themeselves. Objects
  without vertex attributes will consume less memory (two
  words per edge less than in previous releases). Each
  vertex can now have both a vertex color and UV coordinates.
  
  The wings file format should be completely compatible. If
  you load a wings file containing an object with both vertex
  colors and UV coordinates into an older release of Wings,
  only the UV coordinates will be kept. (If you resave such
  a file from an older version of Wings, the vertex colors
  will be permanently lost.)
  
  Most commands have not been updated yet to take full
  advantage of the new vertex attribute implementation. So
  while Ambient Occlusion will preserve existing UV coordinates,
  there is no way yet to show vertex colors at the same time
  as textures.
  
  You can use the commands "Material Mode" and "Vertex Color Mode" in
  the body mode menu to switch between seeing materials/textures and
  vertex colors. (The commands are not new, but there were few
  situations in which they were needed in previous releases of Wings.)
  In a future release, we will probably eliminate those commands and
  extend materials so that you can choose whether vertex colors,
  materials/textures, or a mixture of both should be shown.
  
  Performance seems to be about the same if there are no
  vertex attributes, but somewhat slower for models with
  vertex attributes.
  
  For developers: Plug-ins using #edge.a and #edge.b will not
  compile. Instead use the new wings_va module that provides an API
  to the vertex attributes. I have tried to comment each
  exported function in the API. [bjorng]

--- 1.1.4.1 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- Having wireframe on and workmode off would cause a
  crash. (Thanks to Siber.) [bjorng]

- Select By|Vertices With could select hidden vertices
  (i.e. vertices surrounded only by hidden faces). Similarly,
  Select By|Random could select hidden edges or vertices,
  and Select By|Short Edges and Select By|Sharp Edges could
  select hidden edges. [bjorng]

- The Wavefront (OBJ) exporter will now export smoothing
  groups based on the hard edges in the model. [bjorng]

- For developers: There is a new module wings_va
  which is ultimately meant to encapsulate the details
  of how vertex attributes (i.e. vertex colors and UV
  coordinates) are stored. In this release, wings_va has
  an API mostly for retrieving vertex attributes (i.e.
  it does not yet handle updating of vertex attributes).
  In particular, all functions in wings_face that could
  retrieve vertex attributes (such as vinfo_ccw/2 and
  fold_vinfo/4) have been removed. [bjorng]

--- 1.1.4 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- For developers: Release notes to be included in a release
  should no longer be directly added to NOTES-1.1 files, but
  instead be written into the check-in comment. Everything in
  a comment from "NOTE:" (without the quotations marks) at
  the beginning of a line to the end of the check-in comment,
  will be included in the release notes.
  
  To extract the release notes, run the script tools/extract_notes.
  It will extract and print all notes for all commits after
  the tag for the latest release. [bjorng]

- The Edge Ring command (Select|Edge Loop|Edge Ring) would
  select edges between hidden faces. [bjorng]

- Selection (finding out which face is under the mouse
  cursor) used to be done using a special selection render
  mode in OpenGL. However, this mode does not work well
  in all OpenGL drivers. Therefore I have implemented my
  own code for selection handling in C as a driver for the
  Erlang emulator. (Thanks to FonteBoa for testing.) [bjorng]

- The proxy mode has been optimized by using vertex arrays. [dgud]

--- 1.1.3 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- Torsten Manz updated the German translation. [bjorng]

- Menu Cleanup: Consolidated Extrude with Extrude Region and Extract Region with
  Extract Faces. Since there is now only one heading each for Extrude and
  Extract, the mouse buttons that activate specific commands have been changed.
  Please see the related info lines for details. [optigon]

- Crash when using Shift Spherical (mmb option) now fixed.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- Edge|Collapse now deletes edges more uniformly than the previous
  implementation. Also, a Rmb option has been added to automatically cleanup
  any newly created isolated vertices resulting from the collapse edges.
  (Thanks to deerwood and Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- On OpenGL implementations without support for multisampling,
  there would be (harmless) error messages written to the console
  Develop|OpenGL Errors had been turned on. Changed to only
  attempt to use multisampling if the OpenGL implementation supports
  it, and no longer showing the checkbox in the preferences for
  turning on/off multisampling if the OpenGL implementation does
  not support it. [bjorng]

- If a command executed through a hotkey causes an error,
  a dialog box with some help will be shown. [bjorng]

- Major rewrite of how geometry data is sent to OpenGL. We used
  to have a specially written driver, but for future compatibility
  we cannot use a driver. Instead we use vertex arrays.

  This is the first step in this direction and we expect to do
  further optimizations. For the moment, some display updates
  can be slower and some can be faster than before.

  As part of this change, the OpenGL renderer has been removed.
  Sorry for any inconvenience, but it had to go. [dgud & bjorng]

- This release uses R13B01. A bug fix in the array module in R13B01
  eliminates a crash that occurred when all edges in an object
  were dissolved. [bjorng]

- This development release also includes all bug fixes in the 1.0.1 release.

--- 1.1.2 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- Select Similar Normals with the option Connected Faces Only and
  a selection comprising multiple objects would cause a crash.
  (Thanks to pauljs75.) [bjorng]

- Using the Slide command with Clean (Ctrl+Alt+L) would crash.
  (Thanks to gordo.) [bjorng]

- AutoUV: Doing ReMap UV and choosing Strech Optimization would
  cause a crash. (Thanks to betelguese.) [bjorng]

- When creating a texture from vertex colors in the AutoUV window, the
  colors will be properly interpolated (smoothed). [scorpius]

- Keyboard events in Tweak while dragging could cause slow downs. Now Fixed.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- Additional Geometry Windows can now be closed from within Tweak mode.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- Dragging in Tweak is no longer limited to the size of the current window.
  [optigon]

- Conflicts due to mouse events in adjacent Geometry Windows have been solved by
  locking the focus to the original window during paint selection and dragging
  in Tweak Mode. (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- New Tweak option to set Tweak Magnet Increment. [optigon]

- Spherical UV mapping corrected. [dgud]

- There are two new commands in the optional Develop menu:

  * Develop|OpenGL Errors to check for and display OpenGL errors after
    each command.
  * Develop|Print Scene Size to print the scene size.

  Also, the existing commands Time Commands and Undo Stat now handle
  plug-in commands properly.

  The command Tools|Memory Info has been removed. [bjorng]

- New in Tools menu: Ambient-Occlusion Generator/Baker. It works on a per-
  vertex basis and uses a standard inside-out approach. Mesh subdivision
  yields more accuracy. The results are stored in the vertex-colors and can
  also be baked to a texture through AutoUV. [scorpius]

- Extended Shift plugin to work in all selection modes. [optigon]

- New Plugin: Extract Faces. Like Extract Region but extracts individual faces.
  [optigon]

--- 1.1.1 -------------------------------------------------------------------
- The data structure for the vertex tables has been changed.
  (There is one vertex table to keep track of the vertex positions,
  and another vertex table used for finding edges and face around
  the vertex.) The new data structure is faster and uses less memory.
  [bjorng]

- When displaying vertices and edges, a feature in OpenGL called vertex
  arrays is used to faster transfer the data from Wings into OpenGL.
  This way of displaying geometry is slightly faster than the previous
  method. [dgud, bjorng]

- ESDL updated to 1.0.1. (The next release in the 1.1 series will probably
  not work without that version of ESDL.) [bjorng]

- Magnets are now drawn correctly in Tweak when selections across multiple
  objects are dragged. [optigon]

- Selectings multiple objects in Tweak and calling a command via a hotkey would
  only affect one of the objects. Now corrected. [optigon]

- Crash reported by Fonte Boa corrected. [optigon]

- Tweak mode temporary selection fix. [optigon]

--- 1.1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added a new preference in the Misc tab to turn on a Develop menu
  containing various tools for the Wings developers. [bjorng]

- Added a command to the new Develop menu to automatically time
  all executed commands. The command name and time will be printed
  to the console. [bjorng]

- Added a command to the new Develop menu to automatically print
  out information about the undo queue. [bjorng]

- The data structure for the edge table has been changed. The new
  data structure is faster and uses less memory. Approximately 4
  words (1 word = 4 bytes) per edge is saved.

  Plug-ins that depend on the edge table being a gb_tree will not
  work. More details can be found in the Change log (which follows
  these notes at Sourceforge). [bjorng, optigon]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
