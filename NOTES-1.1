--- 1.1.4 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- For developers: Release notes to be included in a release
  should no longer be directly added to NOTES-1.1 files, but
  instead be written into the check-in comment. Everything in
  a comment from "NOTE:" (without the quotations marks) at
  the beginning of a line to the end of the check-in comment,
  will be included in the release notes.
  
  To extract the release notes, run the script tools/extract_notes.
  It will extract and print all notes for all commits after
  the tag for the latest release. [bjorng]

- The Edge Ring command (Select|Edge Loop|Edge Ring) would
  select edges between hidden faces. [bjorng]

- Selection (finding out which face is under the mouse
  cursor) used to be done using a special selection render
  mode in OpenGL. However, this mode does not work well
  in all OpenGL drivers. Therefore I have implemented my
  own code for selection handling in C as a driver for the
  Erlang emulator. (Thanks to FonteBoa for testing.) [bjorng]

- The proxy mode has been optimized by using vertex arrays. [dgud]

--- 1.1.3 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- Torsten Manz updated the German translation. [bjorng]

- Menu Cleanup: Consolidated Extrude with Extrude Region and Extract Region with
  Extract Faces. Since there is now only one heading each for Extrude and
  Extract, the mouse buttons that activate specific commands have been changed.
  Please see the related info lines for details. [optigon]

- Crash when using Shift Spherical (mmb option) now fixed.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- Edge|Collapse now deletes edges more uniformly than the previous
  implementation. Also, a Rmb option has been added to automatically cleanup
  any newly created isolated vertices resulting from the collapse edges.
  (Thanks to deerwood and Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- On OpenGL implementations without support for multisampling,
  there would be (harmless) error messages written to the console
  Develop|OpenGL Errors had been turned on. Changed to only
  attempt to use multisampling if the OpenGL implementation supports
  it, and no longer showing the checkbox in the preferences for
  turning on/off multisampling if the OpenGL implementation does
  not support it. [bjorng]

- If a command executed through a hotkey causes an error,
  a dialog box with some help will be shown. [bjorng]

- Major rewrite of how geometry data is sent to OpenGL. We used
  to have a specially written driver, but for future compatibility
  we cannot use a driver. Instead we use vertex arrays.

  This is the first step in this direction and we expect to do
  further optimizations. For the moment, some display updates
  can be slower and some can be faster than before.

  As part of this change, the OpenGL renderer has been removed.
  Sorry for any inconvenience, but it had to go. [dgud & bjorng]

- This release uses R13B01. A bug fix in the array module in R13B01
  eliminates a crash that occurred when all edges in an object
  were dissolved. [bjorng]

- This development release also includes all bug fixes in the 1.0.1 release.

--- 1.1.2 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- Select Similar Normals with the option Connected Faces Only and
  a selection comprising multiple objects would cause a crash.
  (Thanks to pauljs75.) [bjorng]

- Using the Slide command with Clean (Ctrl+Alt+L) would crash.
  (Thanks to gordo.) [bjorng]

- AutoUV: Doing ReMap UV and choosing Strech Optimization would
  cause a crash. (Thanks to betelguese.) [bjorng]

- When creating a texture from vertex colors in the AutoUV window, the
  colors will be properly interpolated (smoothed). [scorpius]

- Keyboard events in Tweak while dragging could cause slow downs. Now Fixed.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- Additional Geometry Windows can now be closed from within Tweak mode.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- Dragging in Tweak is no longer limited to the size of the current window.
  [optigon]

- Conflicts due to mouse events in adjacent Geometry Windows have been solved by
  locking the focus to the original window during paint selection and dragging
  in Tweak Mode. (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- New Tweak option to set Tweak Magnet Increment. [optigon]

- Spherical UV mapping corrected. [dgud]

- There are two new commands in the optional Develop menu:

  * Develop|OpenGL Errors to check for and display OpenGL errors after
    each command.
  * Develop|Print Scene Size to print the scene size.

  Also, the existing commands Time Commands and Undo Stat now handle
  plug-in commands properly.

  The command Tools|Memory Info has been removed. [bjorng]

- New in Tools menu: Ambient-Occlusion Generator/Baker. It works on a per-
  vertex basis and uses a standard inside-out approach. Mesh subdivision
  yields more accuracy. The results are stored in the vertex-colors and can
  also be baked to a texture through AutoUV. [scorpius]

- Extended Shift plugin to work in all selection modes. [optigon]

- New Plugin: Extract Faces. Like Extract Region but extracts individual faces.
  [optigon]

--- 1.1.1 -------------------------------------------------------------------
- The data structure for the vertex tables has been changed.
  (There is one vertex table to keep track of the vertex positions,
  and another vertex table used for finding edges and face around
  the vertex.) The new data structure is faster and uses less memory.
  [bjorng]

- When displaying vertices and edges, a feature in OpenGL called vertex
  arrays is used to faster transfer the data from Wings into OpenGL.
  This way of displaying geometry is slightly faster than the previous
  method. [dgud, bjorng]

- ESDL updated to 1.0.1. (The next release in the 1.1 series will probably
  not work without that version of ESDL.) [bjorng]

- Magnets are now drawn correctly in Tweak when selections across multiple
  objects are dragged. [optigon]

- Selectings multiple objects in Tweak and calling a command via a hotkey would
  only affect one of the objects. Now corrected. [optigon]

- Crash reported by Fonte Boa corrected. [optigon]

- Tweak mode temporary selection fix. [optigon]

--- 1.1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added a new preference in the Misc tab to turn on a Develop menu
  containing various tools for the Wings developers. [bjorng]

- Added a command to the new Develop menu to automatically time
  all executed commands. The command name and time will be printed
  to the console. [bjorng]

- Added a command to the new Develop menu to automatically print
  out information about the undo queue. [bjorng]

- The data structure for the edge table has been changed. The new
  data structure is faster and uses less memory. Approximately 4
  words (1 word = 4 bytes) per edge is saved.

  Plug-ins that depend on the edge table being a gb_tree will not
  work. More details can be found in the Change log (which follows
  these notes at Sourceforge). [bjorng, optigon]
