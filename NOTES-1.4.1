- Major update to the Traditional Chinese translation of Wings
  including AutoUV, many plugins, tools, and other interface strings.
  Many thanks to szzz for this amazing contribution! [optigon]

- Wings could crash when launching and opening a file at the same
  time . The cause was the ets table for fonts could not be written to
  while the Progress Bar was active. ets tables can only be accessed from
  the process they are created in unless specifically stated. In Wings the
  PB run on a separate process so accessing the ets font table while the
  PB was active led to a badarg since the call was not allowed. The font
  table is now set to public so it can be accessed by any process.
  (Thanks to dgud and those who reported the crash) [optigon]

- Help dialog formatting adjustments for Asian fonts. [optigon]

  strings and some key plugins including AutoUV. Many thanks to korea3d

  he found during the process. [optigon]
