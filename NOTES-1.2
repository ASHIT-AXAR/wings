Changes in 1.2.rc3 (compared to 1.2.rc2)
========================================

- Wings could not always save the preferences on Windows Vista
  and Windows 7 because the registry has a different layout.
  Wings will no longer attempt to use the registry to find an
  appropriate directoy into which preferences should be saved,
  but will use the documented Windows API function.
  
  Note to developers: You will need to adjust your scripts/shortcuts
  for starting Wings. See BUILD.win32. [bjorng]

- Dissolving or collapsing an isolated vertex could
  cause a crash. (Thanks to ania.) [bjorng]

- Fixed various hidden/hole face drawing problems. Hidden hard
  edges was drawn reported by Ania. Smooth-preview showed edges on
  hidden faces and the backside of visible faces was not shown in flat
  shaded view. [dgud]

Changes in 1.2.rc2 (compared to 1.2.rc1)
========================================

- Using Virtual Mirror on the same object twice would leave an illegal hole in
  the object. [optigon]

- Face|Intrude would crash if a virtual mirror was present. [optigon]

- Tools|Set Default Axis now offers individual Point and Axis assignments. [optigon]

- Rewrite of Object|Weld to improve its handling of neighbouring faces. [optigon]

- There are a couple of new Camera features which improve upon the
  Highlight Aim tool. The first is a new option to allow auto aiming while
  zooming the camera in when part of the model is highlighted. This feature
  works best when Highlight Aim is enabled. By default the new zoom behaviour
  is turned off. To enable it, go to Edit|Preferences|Camera|Scroll Wheel and
  tick the box labeled "Zooming in aims Camera".
  The second new Highlight Aim improvement, is that it will now recognise
  if you are aiming at the original or mirrored side of a model that contains
  a virtual mirror. [optigon]

- Torsten Manz (flugel3d) has updated to the German translation of Wings.
  [Torsten Manz]

- Vital Proulx (Tulip Vorlax) has added a much updated French translation
  to Wings. [Vital Proulx]

- Optimized and improved the ambient occlusion plugin. [dgud]

- AUV: When segmenting tries to minimize the number of materials used. [dgud]

- AUV: Decreased the amount vertices and charts were displaced. [dgud]

Changes in 1.2.rc1 (compared to 1.1.16)
=======================================

- Using Weld to weld holes could cause subsequent crashes.
  (Problem reported by Mark Whittemore.) [bjorng]

- When a single object is selected, the information about the
  object in the upper left corner of the Geometry window will now
  also show the numbers of holes the object has (if it has at least
  one hole). [bjorng]

- There is a new Shell Extrude command that is a combination
  of Extrude (Region) and Extract. [optigon]

- Several minor bug fixes by optigon.

Notable new features in 1.2 (compared to 1.0.2)
===============================================

* The object mode (vertex color/material) for objects has
  been eliminated.
  
  Instead materials have a Vertex Colors setting that can be
  "Ignore" (don't use vertex colors; default for new materials),
  "Set" (to use vertex colors instead of the colors in the material),
  and "Multiply" (to multiply vertex colors with the diffuse texture).
  
  The material "default" has "Set" as the value for the "Vertex Colors"
  property, meaning that if you assign vertex colors to face having
  the "default" material, the vertex colors will be visible.
  
  There is a new command (with a sub-menu) in the body mode menu called
  "Vertex Attributes".
  
  When opening a .wings file written by Wings 1.1.7 or earlier, the
  object modes for the objects in the file will be ignored. If there
  are vertex colors, they will be visible on faces that have
  the 'default' material assigned. For faces with other materials,
  the colors or textures in the material will be shown (even if
  the object was in vertex color mode).
  
  When saving a .wings file in this version of Wings and opening
  it in an older version of Wings, all objects will be in
  material mode (even if they have vertex colors).

* Wings have had the _hole_ material for a long time to fake
  holes by marking faces that should not be included when exporting.
  
  There is a new Face|Hole command to create a holes
  that looks like holes also in the Geometry window.
  
  To remove a hole, select a face adjacent to the hole and RMB
  click on the Face|Hole command to create a face to cover the
  hole.
  
  When loading old .wings files, all faces containing the _hole_
  material will be converted to the new type of hole.
  
  If you load a .wings file saved with this version of Wings in
  an old release, the holes will become hidden faces, but they
  will NOT have the _hole_ material (i.e. they will not behave
  as holes when exported).

* The smooth proxy is now updated directly when invoking
  interactive commands.

* Menu Cleanup: Consolidated Extrude with Extrude Region and Extract Region with
  Extract Faces. Since there is now only one heading each for Extrude and
  Extract, the mouse buttons that activate specific commands have been changed.

* Collada export. Objects including UV coordinates and materials
  are exported. Lights and cameras are not exported yet.

* New in Tools menu: Ambient-Occlusion Generator/Baker. It works on a per-
  vertex basis and uses a standard inside-out approach. Mesh subdivision
  yields more accuracy. The results are stored in the vertex-colors and can
  also be baked to a texture through AutoUV.

* Many improvements and bug fixes in the Tweak mode.

* The Wavefront (OBJ) exporter will now export smoothing
  groups based on the hard edges in the model.

Eliminated annoyances
=====================

* If View|Scene Lights has been turned on, but the scene
  contains no lights, the usual modeling lights will be turned on
  instead so the objects do not turn black.

* When displaying objects that have a virtual mirror face in
  the smooth preview mode (i.e. turning off workmode by pressing TAB),
  the seam between the real part of the object and mirror image will
  now be soft.

Performance
===========

* Picking (i.e. finding out which face is under the mouse
  cursor) is no longer done using OpenGL, but by our own
  C code, which is both faster and more reliable.

* The internal data structures for edge and vertex tables require
  less memory than in Wings 1.0, which should also improve
  peformance.

* The display code has been extensively rewritten and now uses
  vertex buffers in OpenGL. It should be faster in most
  circumstances.
